üîç How It Works
Clean Architecture Layers
Data Layer: Handles data sources like Firebase and IMDb via repositories.
Domain Layer: Contains business logic in use cases, ensuring single responsibility.
Presentation Layer: Manages UI using Jetpack Compose and ViewModels.
Parental Guide
IMDb parental guide data is scraped using Jsoup.
The data is cached in Firebase Realtime Database to reduce redundant web requests.
The app prioritizes cached data for better performance.
Localization
The app supports multiple languages, including:

English (en-US)
German (de-DE)
Spanish (es-ES)
French (fr-FR)
Turkish (tr-TR), and more.
Streaming Providers
Users can discover streaming providers based on their location.
Links are dynamically generated for each movie or show.
